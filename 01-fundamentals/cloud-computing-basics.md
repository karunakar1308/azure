# Cloud Computing Basics

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. On-Demand Self-Service
- Provision computing capabilities as needed automatically
- No human interaction required with service provider
- Access resources 24/7 through web portal or API

### 2. Broad Network Access
- Available over the network
- Accessible through standard mechanisms
- Works on various platforms (mobile, laptop, desktop)

### 3. Resource Pooling
- Provider's resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
- Multi-tenant model with different physical and virtual resources
- Resources dynamically assigned and reassigned based on demand

### 4. Rapid Elasticity
- Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released
- Scale up or down automatically based on demand
- Appears unlimited from user perspective

### 5. Measured Service
- Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported
- Pay-per-use or subscription model
- Provides transparency for both provider and consumer

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
**What it is:** Virtual machines, storage, networks

**You manage:**
- Applications
- Data
- Runtime
- Middleware
- Operating System

**Provider manages:**
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

**Azure Examples:** Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, Storage Accounts

**Use Cases:**
- Website hosting
- Backup and recovery
- Development and testing environments
- High-performance computing

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
**What it is:** Complete development and deployment environment in the cloud

**You manage:**
- Applications
- Data

**Provider manages:**
- Runtime
- Middleware
- Operating System
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

**Azure Examples:** Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions

**Use Cases:**
- Web application development
- API development and management
- Mobile backend
- Business analytics

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
**What it is:** Complete software solution delivered over the internet

**You manage:**
- Data (limited)
- Access control

**Provider manages:** Everything else

**Azure Examples:** Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Azure DevOps

**Use Cases:**
- Email and collaboration (Microsoft 365)
- Customer relationship management
- Enterprise resource planning

## Cloud Deployment Models

### 1. Public Cloud
- Resources owned and operated by third-party cloud service provider
- Delivered over the public internet
- Shared infrastructure among multiple organizations
- **Examples:** Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud

**Advantages:**
- Lower costs (no hardware to purchase)
- No maintenance
- High scalability
- High reliability

**Best for:**
- Web-based applications
- Development and testing
- Organizations with fluctuating demands

### 2. Private Cloud
- Cloud infrastructure used exclusively by one organization
- Can be on-premises or hosted by a third party
- Greater control and security

**Advantages:**
- More control over resources
- Enhanced security and privacy
- Customization options

**Best for:**
- Highly regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
- Organizations with strict security requirements
- Large enterprises with stable workloads

### 3. Hybrid Cloud
- Combination of public and private clouds
- Data and applications shared between them
- Greater flexibility and deployment options

**Advantages:**
- Flexibility to choose where to run workloads
- Cost optimization
- Gradual cloud migration
- Keep sensitive data on-premises

**Best for:**
- Organizations with varying workload requirements
- Compliance and regulatory needs
- Disaster recovery scenarios

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

### Cost Reduction
- Eliminates capital expense of buying hardware
- Pay only for what you use
- Reduced IT operational costs

### Speed and Agility
- Resources available in minutes
- Faster time to market
- Easy experimentation

### Global Scale
- Deploy applications in multiple regions worldwide
- Deliver content closer to users
- Reduce latency

### Performance
- Runs on secure datacenters
- Latest generation of hardware
- Regular upgrades without downtime

### Reliability
- Data backup and disaster recovery easier and less expensive
- Multiple redundant sites
- High availability guarantees (SLAs)

### Security
- Broad set of security policies and technologies
- Centralized security management
- Compliance certifications
